# CHANGELOG

This is a manually generated log to track changes to the repository for each release.
Each section should include general headers such as **Implemented enhancements**
and **Merged pull requests**. Critical items to know are:

 - renamed commands
 - deprecated / removed commands
 - changed defaults
 - backward incompatible changes
 - migration guidance
 - changed behaviour

The versions coincide with releases on pip.

## [0.2.x](https://github.com/snakemake/snakedeploy/tree/master) (0.0.x)
 - adding option to template with GitHub (if GitHub token is present) (0.0.11)
 - beta release with working clone (0.0.1)
 - skeleton release (0.0.0)
